/**
 * <b>NGS Index</b>
 *
 * <p>Dual Indices employed for pooled measurements during Multiplexing in the library prep process.
 * Multiplexing allows large numbers of libraries to be pooled and sequenced simultaneously
 * during a single run on an instrument.
 * In the NGS context a dual indices system is employed in pooled samples consisting of the
 * indices I5 and I7 in the following combinations:
 *    Double indexing i5 + i7
 *    Single indexing i7
 * A pooled measurement always must have at least one of the index combinations,
 * meaning a singular index of i5 is NOT possible and the index is irrelevant in a non-pooled context.
 * Additional information can be found at <a href="https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/ngs-library-prep/multiplexing.html">Multiplexing</a>
