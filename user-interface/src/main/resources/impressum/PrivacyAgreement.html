  <h2 id="m2427">Relevant legal bases</h2>
  <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>In the following, you will find an
    overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please
    note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your
    or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases
    are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection
    declaration.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to
      the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)</strong> -
      Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the
      request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is
      necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</strong> - the processing is necessary
      for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided
      that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the
      protection of personal data, do not prevail.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data
    protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany.
    This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data
    Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special
    provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of
    special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as
    automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of
    the individual federal states may apply.</p>
  <p><strong>Relevant legal basis according to the Swiss Data Protection Act: </strong>If you are
    located in Switzerland, we process your data based on the Federal Act on Data Protection
    (referred to as "Swiss DPA"). Unlike the GDPR, for instance, the Swiss DPA does not generally
    require that a legal basis for processing personal data be stated and that the processing of
    personal data is conducted in good faith, lawfully and proportionately (Art. 6 para. 1 and 2 of
    the Swiss DPA). Furthermore, we only collect personal data for a specific purpose recognizable
    to the data subject and process it only in a manner compatible with this purpose (Art. 6 para. 3
    of the Swiss DPA).</p>
  <p><strong>Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA: </strong>These privacy
    policy serves both to provide information pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection
    (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note
    that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR
    are applied. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP such as "processing" of
    "personal data", "predominant interest", and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms
    used in the GDPR, namely "processing" of "personal data", as well as "legitimate interest" and
    "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of these terms will continue
    to be determined according to the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.</p>

  <h2 id="m27">Security Precautions</h2>
  <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal
    requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the
    nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and
    severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security
    appropriate to the risk.</p>
  <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and
    availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access
    to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established
    procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we
    are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal
    data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service
    providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.</p>
  <p>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data
    of users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL
    encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the
    cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the
    information that is transferred between the website or app and the user's browser (or between
    two servers), thereby safeguarding the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced
    and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions conform to the highest security
    standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the
    display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being
    securely and encryptedly transmitted.</p>

  <h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>In the course of processing personal data, it may happen that this data is transmitted to or
    disclosed to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or
    individuals. Recipients of this data may include service providers tasked with IT duties or
    providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe
    the legal requirements and particularly conclude relevant contracts or agreements that serve to
    protect your data with the recipients of your data.</p>

  <h2 id="m24">International data transfers</h2>
  <p>Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the
    European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if the processing is done within
    the context of using third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other
    individuals, entities, or companies, this is only done in accordance with legal requirements. If
    the data protection level in the third country has been recognized by an adequacy decision
    (Article 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers only
    occur if the data protection level is otherwise ensured, especially through standard contractual
    clauses (Article 46 (2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in cases of contractual or legally
    required transfers (Article 49 (1) GDPR). Furthermore, we provide you with the basis of
    third-country transfers from individual third-country providers, with adequacy decisions
    primarily serving as the foundation. "Information regarding third-country transfers and existing
    adequacy decisions can be obtained from the information provided by the EU Commission:
    <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener">>https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en.</a>
  </p>
  <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Within the context of the so-called "Data Privacy
    Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the data protection level for certain
    companies from the USA as secure within the adequacy decision of 10th July 2023. The list of
    certified companies as well as additional information about the DPF can be found on the website
    of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/"
                                           target="_blank" rel="noopener">>https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/.</a>
    We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework
    as part of our data protection notices.</p>
  <p>Disclosure of Personal Data Abroad: In accordance with the Swiss Data Protection Act (Swiss
    DPA), we only disclose personal data abroad when an appropriate level of protection for the
    affected persons is ensured (Art. 16 Swiss DPA). If the Federal Council does not determine that
    there is an adequate level of protection (list of states: <a
        href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/datenschutz/internationales/anerkennung-staaten.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">>https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/datenschutz/internationales/anerkennung-staaten.html</a>),
    we implement alternative security measures. These measures may include international agreements,
    specific guarantees, data protection clauses in contracts, standard data protection clauses
    approved by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), or internal
    company data protection regulations previously recognised by the FDPIC or a competent data
    protection authority of another country.</p>
  <p>Under Art. 16 of the Swiss DSG, exceptions can be made for the disclosure of data abroad if
    certain conditions are met, including the consent of the affected person, contract execution,
    public interest, protection of life or physical integrity, publicly made data or data from a
    legally provided register. Such disclosures always comply with the legal requirements.</p>

  <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the
    underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to
    cases where the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer
    needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if statutory obligations or special interests require a
    longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
  <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or whose storage
    is necessary for legal prosecution or protection of the rights of other natural or legal
    persons, must be archived accordingly.</p>
  <p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data
    specifically applicable to certain processing processes.</p>
  <p>In cases where multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date are specified, the
    longest period always prevails.</p>
  <p>If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it
    automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period
    occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is
    stored, the event triggering the deadline is the time at which the termination or other
    termination of the legal relationship takes effect.</p>
  <p>Data that is no longer stored for its originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements
    or other reasons are processed exclusively for the reasons justifying their retention.</p>

  <h2 id="m735">Video Conferences, Online Meetings, Webinars and Screen-Sharing</h2>
  <p>We use platforms and applications of other providers (hereinafter referred to as "Conference
    Platforms") for the purpose of conducting video and audio conferences, webinars and other types
    of video and audio meetings (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Conference"). When using
    the Conference Platforms and their services, we comply with the legal requirements. </p>
  <p><strong>Data processed by Conference Platforms:</strong> In the course of participation in a
    Conference, the Data of the participants listed below are processed. The scope of the processing
    depends, on the one hand, on which data is requested in the context of a specific Conference
    (e.g., provision of access data or clear names) and which optional information is provided by
    the participants. In addition to processing for the purpose of conducting the conference,
    participants' Data may also be processed by the Conference Platforms for security purposes or
    service optimization. The processed Date includes personal information (first name, last name),
    contact information (e-mail address, telephone number), access data (access codes or passwords),
    profile pictures, information on professional position/function, the IP address of the internet
    access, information on the participants' end devices, their operating system, the browser and
    its technical and linguistic settings, information on the content-related communication
    processes, i.e. entries in chats and audio and video data, as well as the use of other available
    functions (e.g. surveys). The content of communications is encrypted to the extent technically
    provided by the conference providers. If participants are registered as users with the
    Conference Platforms, then further data may be processed in accordance with the agreement with
    the respective Conference Provider.</p>
  <p><strong>Logging and recording:</strong> If text entries, participation results (e.g. from
    surveys) as well as video or audio recordings are recorded, this will be transparently
    communicated to the participants in advance and they will be asked - if necessary - for their
    consent.</p>
  <p><strong>Data protection measures of the participants:</strong> Please refer to the data privacy
    information of the Conference Platforms for details on the processing of your data and select
    the optimum security and data privacy settings for you within the framework of the settings of
    the conference platforms. Furthermore, please ensure data and privacy protection in the
    background of your recording for the duration of a Conference (e.g., by notifying roommates,
    locking doors, and using the background masking function, if technically possible). Links to the
    conference rooms as well as access data, should not be passed on to unauthorized third parties.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> Insofar as, in addition to the Conference Platforms, we
    also process users' data and ask users for their consent to use contents from the Conferences or
    certain functions (e.g. consent to a recording of Conferences), the legal basis of the
    processing is this consent. Furthermore, our processing may be necessary for the fulfillment of
    our contractual obligations (e.g. in participant lists, in the case of reprocessing of
    Conference results, etc.). Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate
    interests in efficient and secure communication with our communication partners.</p>

  <h2 id="m42">Terminology and Definitions</h2>
  <p>In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology used in this privacy policy.
    Where the terminology is legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following
    explanations, however, are primarily intended to aid understanding.</p>
  <ul class="glossary">
    <li><strong>Contact data:</strong> Contact details are essential information that enables
      communication with individuals or organizations. They include, among others, phone numbers,
      postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as means of communication like social media
      handles and instant messaging identifiers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Content data:</strong> Content data comprise information generated in the process of
      creating, editing, and publishing content of all types. This category of data may include
      texts, images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published across various
      platforms and media. Content data are not limited to the content itself but also include
      metadata providing information about the content, such as tags, descriptions, authorship
      details, and publication dates.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Contract data:</strong> Contract data are specific details pertaining to the
      formalisation of an agreement between two or more parties. They document the terms under which
      services or products are provided, exchanged, or sold. This category of data is essential for
      managing and fulfilling contractual obligations and includes both the identification of the
      contracting parties and the specific terms and conditions of the agreement. Contract data may
      encompass the start and end dates of the contract, the nature of the agreed-upon services or
      products, pricing arrangements, payment terms, termination rights, extension options, and
      special conditions or clauses. They serve as the legal foundation for the relationship between
      the parties and are crucial for clarifying rights and duties, enforcing claims, and resolving
      disputes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Controller:</strong> "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public
      authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes
      and means of the processing of personal data.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Employees:</strong> As employees, individuals are those who are engaged in an
      employment relationship, whether as staff, employees, or in similar positions. Employment
      refers to a legal relationship between an employer and an employee, established through an
      employment contract or agreement. It entails the obligation of the employer to pay the
      employee remuneration while the employee performs their work. The employment relationship
      encompasses various stages, including establishment, where the employment contract is
      concluded, execution, where the employee carries out their work activities, and termination,
      when the employment relationship ends, whether through termination, mutual agreement, or
      otherwise.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Log data:</strong> Protocol data, or log data, refer to information regarding events
      or activities that have been logged within a system or network. These data typically include
      details such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other specifics
      about the usage or operation of a system. Protocol data is often used for analyzing system
      issues, monitoring security, or generating performance reports.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Meta, communication and process data:</strong> Meta-, communication, and procedural
      data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and
      managed. Meta-data, also known as data about data, include information that describes the
      context, origin, and structure of other data. They can include details about file size,
      creation date, the author of a document, and modification histories. Communication data
      capture the exchange of information between users across various channels, such as email
      traffic, call logs, messages in social networks, and chat histories, including the involved
      parties, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describe the processes and
      operations within systems or organisations, including workflow documentations, logs of
      transactions and activities, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying procedures.

    <li><strong>Performance and behavioural data:</strong>
      Performance and behavioral data refer to information related to how individuals perform tasks
      or behave within a certain context, such as in an educational, work, or social setting. This
      data may include metrics such as productivity, efficiency, quality of work, attendance, and
      adherence to policies or procedures. Behavioral data could encompass interactions with
      colleagues, communication styles, decision-making processes, and responses to various
      situations. These types of data are often used for performance evaluations, training and
      development purposes, and decision-making within organizations.

    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Usage data refer to information that captures how users
      interact with digital products, services, or platforms. These data encompass a wide range of
      information that demonstrates how users utilise applications, which features they prefer, how
      long they spend on specific pages, and through what paths they navigate an application. Usage
      data can also include the frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device
      information, and location data. They are particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour,
      optimising user experiences, personalising content, and improving products or services.
      Furthermore, usage data play a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential
      problem areas within digital offerings
