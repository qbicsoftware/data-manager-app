# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goal
Our vision is to build a research data management platform that enables scientists to plan, document, and manage their research projects in a structured, transparent, and FAIR-compliant manner.

The platform will support the full lifecycle of high-throughput research workflows — from project and experimental design documentation, through sample registration and measurement parameter capture, to raw data registration and quality tracking. It will integrate partner laboratories performing high-throughput analyses (e.g., next-generation sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics) and ensure that all managed data fulfills FAIR and CARE principles.

By combining structured metadata capture, quality assessment, and interoperability, the platform will provide a reliable foundation for reproducible, transparent, and reusable research.
